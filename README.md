# Wang tile Visualizer

This is a very basic wang tile visualizer that makes use of the ppm format to generate an image for its output

It currently only has a single shape of tiles which is triangles like these examples in: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_tile

## Objective 

The main objective of this repo is exploring the use of zigs builtin Vector and also explore a little on [tsoding's idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGTuv_KKLFs&list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VYgJXZyQzWjfYUm3MxcvqR0) for wang tiles.

## Usage 

There is nothing fancy built in to this, so if you want to see what it does you just need to compile with default zig build command and run the executable. You will see an output.ppm file which contains the result.
There are some commented chunks of code that change a little the rendering of the tiles, you may want to check it out. Have fun!!
